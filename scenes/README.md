We provide several example scenes to demonstrate different spectral behavior we can control.

- The [Bunny](./bunny/) scene demonstrates simple metamerism under multiple illuminants. Toggle between the left light sources (FL11, D65) and one of the scene objects will become identical to the other.
- The [Cornell Box](./cornell_box/) scene demonstrates editing of indirect-light color behavior. Modify the provided spectral constraint to see that the indirect red scattering on the left-most cornell box depends very much on the box' spectral reflectance.
- The [Fold](./fold/) scene demonstrates editing of interreflection colors. The entire scene comprises one reflectance, and yet the single provided constraint can let you add a significant color component to the folded region.
- The [Mug](./mug/) scene demonstrates metamerism of textured surfaces under close-to-direct light. Toggle between the FL2 and D65 light sources and the mug's texture appearance will change drastically.
- The [Patch](./patch/) scene demonstrates control of metamerism for highly vivid interreflections. Modify the constraints to see how the patches can differ strongly in interreflections only.
- The [Portal](./portal/) scene demonstrates editing of indirect-light color behavior. Almost the entire scene is indirectly illuminated by a far-off light, shining through a portal.
