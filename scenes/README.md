We provide several example scenes to demonstrate different spectral behavior we can control.

- The [Bunny](./bunny/) scene demonstrates direct-light metamerism under multiple illuminants. Toggle between the left light sources (FL11, D65) and one of the scene objects will become identical to the other.
- The [Cornell Box](./cornell_box/) scene demonstrates simple editing of indirect-light color behavior. Modify the provided spectral constraint to see that the indirect red scattering on the left-most cornell box depends very much on the box' spectral reflectance.
- The [Fold](./fold/) scene demonstrates editing of interreflection colors. The entire scene comprises one reflectance, and yet the single provided constraint can let you add a significant color component to the folded region.
